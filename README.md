# ChaTo-notes
A LaTeX package for notes / todos / questions / answers.

I got this package from [Aris Anagnostopoulos](http://aris.me/), which in
turn must have received it from [Carlos "ChaTo" Castillo](http://chato.cl/),
hence the name. According to a note in the package file, Aris modified it. I
modified it further.

It came to me with no license, and I am releasing it under the
[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE) (see also the [NOTICE](./NOTICE) file).
If Aris and/or ChaTo prefer a different license, they know how to get in touch
with me.
